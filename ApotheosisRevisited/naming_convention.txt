The most important thing here is consistency. That said, I follow the GTK+ coding convention, which can be summarized as follows:

All macros and constants in caps: MAX_BUFFER_SIZE, TRACKING_ID_PREFIX.

Struct names and typedef's in camelcase: GtkWidget, TrackingOrder.

Functions that operate on structs: classic C style: gtk_widget_show(), tracking_order_process().

Pointers: nothing fancy here: GtkWidget *foo, TrackingOrder *bar.

Global variables: just don't use global variables. They are evil.

Functions that are there, but shouldn't be called directly, or have obscure uses, or whatever: one or more underscores at the beginning: _refrobnicate_data_tables(), _destroy_cache().
